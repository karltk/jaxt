<title>JAxT java axioms</title>
</head>
<body>
This is a collection JAxT axioms from the Java standard packages, 
based on the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/">Java 5.0 API</a>.
<p>
For each class and interface <tt>X</tt> the axioms are separated into 
<ul>
<li>
<tt>XAxioms implements RequiredAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for axioms formulated from absolute requirements in the documentation,
e.g., that the equals method from <tt>Object</tt> should be an equivalence relation.
</li>
<li>
<tt>XAxiomsStronglyRecommended implements OptionalAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for axioms formulated from strong recommendations in the documentation,
e.g., that a class's natural order is consistent with its equals method (from <tt>Comparable</tt>).
</li>
<li>
<tt>XAxiomsRecommended implements OptionalAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for axioms formulated from recommendations in the documentation,
e.g., the properties for the clone method.
</li>
<li>
<tt>XAxiomsProjectY implements OptionalAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for axioms formulated from project specific recommendations,
e.g., that the equals method should be a congruence relation (for some classes).
We have included this example in <tt>jaxt.java.lang.ComparableAxiomsProject</tt> for the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface.
</li>
<li>
<tt>XAxiomsGlobalRecommendations implements GlobalAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for axioms formulated from global properties on data,
e.g., that hashCode values should be well distributed, see <tt>Object</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
Only data-oriented axioms have been formulated.
Thus thread-related requirements have not been captured.
