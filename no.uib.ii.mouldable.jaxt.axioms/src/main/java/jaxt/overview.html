<p>
  This is an example of JAxT specifications and useage prepared for testing
  with JUnit. The JAxT approach allows us to systematically write properties
  as axioms, axioms which are used as basis for systematic JUnit testing.
  We thereby shift the testing focus from individual test cases, to more
  general properties of the software under development. Hopefully this will
  give better and more systematic support for test-oriented software
  development methods, see the wikipedia 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_development_philosophies">List of software development philosophies</a> 
  for a superficial overview of these and other software design methods.
</p>
  
<p>
  JAxT can also be thought of as a merging between 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">design by contract</a>
  and systematic testing: the contract is formalised by the axioms associated
  with interfaces and classes, while JAxT generates JUnit tests for checking
  adherence to the contract.
</p>

<h2>Writing a contract</h2>

<p>
  An <i>immediate contract</i> is a class or an interface <tt>X</tt> together with a 
  collection of axioms. The axioms are written in (one or more) abstract public
  classes <tt>XA</tt>, which indirectly implements the interface <tt>jaxt.framework.Axioms&lt;X&gt;</tt>,
  via one of
  <ul>
  <li><tt>RequiredAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for required axioms for this and all subtypes,
  </li>
  <li><tt>OptionalAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for axioms for this type but optional for subtypes, and
  </li>
  <li><tt>SubClassAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> for required axioms for all subtypes.
  </li>
  </ul>
  Given optional axioms <tt>XA</tt>, the marker <tt>AxiomSet&lt;XA&gt;</tt> indicates that <tt>XA</tt> are to be acitivated.
</p>  

<p>
The marker <tt>GlobalAxioms&lt;X&gt;</tt> is used to indicate that the axioms pertain to the entire data set.
Used for quality checking of data sets or methods with statistically defined requirements.
</p>

<p>
  These interfaces are empty, their only purpose is
  to allow the JAxT tool to identify that a class <tt>XA</tt> is an axiom 
  class. By letting <tt>XA</tt> extend or implement <tt>X</tt>, JAxT can
  easily figure out which axioms are declared for <tt>X</tt>. The axioms
  may be grouped in several different classes <tt>XA</tt>, e.g., separating
  absolute requirements from recommended behaviour. Consider the method
  <tt>java.lang.Comparable&lt;T&gt;.compareTo(T)</tt> - it is required 
  to be an equivalence relation, but it is only recommended that this
  equivalence relation is the same as the equivalence relation given by
  <tt>java.lang.Object.equals(Object)</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  Each axiom in a class <tt>XA</tt> is a <tt>static public void</tt> method. 
  An axiom may have free variables, which are coded
  as formal arguments to the method. Then the axiom may do any computation
  needed to check a property on its arguments. The checking is normally
  done using assertions from the <tt>junit.framework.Assertions</tt> class.
  It is normal to statically import all the assertion methods from this
  class for <tt>XA</tt>. Thus the axioms are formally written in a 
  Java/JUnit specific logic. Pragmatically the assertion language lets us
  check for 
  
  <ul>
  <li>
    equality using <tt>assertEquals(Object, Object)</tt>,
    which checks that both objects are equal with respect to the
    method <tt>java.lang.Object.equals(Object)</tt>.
   </li>
  <li>
    object identity using <tt>assertSame(Object, Object)</tt>,
    which checks that two object arguments refer to the same 
    <tt>Object</tt>.
  </li>
  <li> 
    satisfaction using <tt>assertTrue(boolean)</tt>,
    which checks that the boolean expression is true.
  </li>
  <li>contradiction using <tt>assertFalse(boolean)</tt>,
   which checks that the boolean expression is true.
  </li>
  <li>
    inconsistency using <tt>assertFail()</tt>,
    which claims failure of the axiom - and is used in the
    checking of exceptions, see e.g. 
    <tt>jaxt.java.lang.CompareableAxioms.compareToProperty6strongSymmetry(Comparable, Comparable)</tt>.
  </li>
  </ul>

<p>  
  All of these assertions also exist for the Java primitive types.
</p>
  
<p>
  By convention an axiom class <tt>XA</tt>, where possible, should
  reside in the same package as <tt>X</tt>. In the current release of
  JAxT, this is a requirement, and there is only one exception:
  Axioms for the standard Java classes and interfaces are placed in 
  <tt>jaxt.java.lang</tt> etc.
</p>

<p>
  The class <tt>X</tt> should of course satisfy all its immediate
  contracts <tt>XA</tt>, but also all contracts for any class it
  inherits from or it implements, either directly or indirectly.
  Thus any class in Java will need to satisfy the requirments on
  <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>, since every Java class inherits from
  it, either directly or indirectly.
</p>

<h2>Generating JAxT tests</h2>

<p>
  When using JAxT within Eclipse, it works in much in the same way as
  generating JUnit tests from within Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
  First you go to the Package Explorer and select the Java file 
  <tt>X.java</tt> that contains the class <tt>X</tt> you want to test.
  Then you right-click on your selection and select <tt>Mould->Create Tests</tt>
  from the popup menu (towards the bottom part of the menu).
</p>

<!--
<p>
  This should give you a "JAxT Test Case" panel where you may choose
  the name of the test class, XTest, etc. The chosen defaults will be OK
  in almost all cases. Press the "Next" button when you are finished.
</p>

<p>
  Now you will get a <tt>JAxT Test Methods</tt> window. This lists all 
  contracts found for <tt>X</tt>. Tick the contracts you want to check
  for. You may also tick on or off individual axioms from the available
  sublists. You may also choose to create a completely new test class
  (removing any old test class with the chosen name for X), or incrementally
  modify the existing test class. Choose the latter option if you have
  modified your previous test class, e.g., by computing test data sets
  in the setUp() method. Press the <tt>Finish</tt> button when you are
  ready.
</p>
-->

<p>
  You will now find the file <tt>XTest.java</tt> alongside with the 
  class <tt>X.java</tt> in your package. Following the defaults,
  <tt>XTest</tt> will be a functioning JUnit test class, except 
  possibly for missing test data sets. See the next section on how to
  add these.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, for every type T in every axiom beloning to X, a test
  generator class <tt>TTestGenerator</tt> will be generated containing
  a method <tt>createTestSet()</tt>. By filling in this method, you
  provide the necessary test tests for that type. 
</p>

<p>
  The generated JUnit test case will be a <tt>public class XTest</tt>
  inheriting from <tt>junit.framework.TestCase</tt> and the file has
  all necessary imports. The test class itself will normally consist
  of the following.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Constructor <tt>public XTest(String name)</tt> as used by JUnit.
  </li>
  <li>
    A fixture consisting of the methods <tt>setUp()</tt> and <tt>tearDown()</tt>.
    The method <tt>setUp()</tt> is called by JUnit before each test
    method, and <tt>tearDown()</tt> is called after each test method.
    The <tt>setUp()</tt> method is typically where the test data are
    computed.
  </li>
  <li>
    A test method for each axiom. The test method will call the axiom
    inside a nested loop which runs through the data set for each
    argument of the axiom. So an axiom <tt>a1(Object, int)</tt> will
    be inside a double loop, running through all elements of the test
    data sets <tt>dataObject</tt> and <tt>dataInt</tt>.
    
    An axiom <tt>a2()</tt>, with no free variables, will not need any
    data loop and just be called as is.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    For every argument type <tt>T</tt>, e.g., <tt>Object</tt>, 
    <tt>int</tt>, <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Comparable</tt>, in the collection
    of axioms, there will be declared a data set <tt>T[] dataT</tt>, 
    e.g., <tt>Object[] dataObject</tt>, <tt>int[] dataInt</tt>, 
    <tt>X[] dataX</tt>, <tt>Comparable[] dataComparable</tt>.
    
    These attribute variables need not be arrays, but must be a 
    collection type with an iterator on the corresponding element
    type.
  </li>    

  <li>
    For each declared data set <tt>dataT</tt>, the <tt>setUp()</tt> 
    method will be extended with the initialisation of this data.
  </li>

  <li>
    If the data is for <tt>X</tt> or a supertype of <tt>X</tt>, a call
    to the (fictive) static method <tt>XTestGenerator.createTestSet()</tt> will
    be inserted. For instance, <tt>dataObject = XTestGenerator.createTestSet()</tt>,
    <tt>dataX = XTestGenerator.createTestSet()</tt>, 
    <tt>dataComparable = XTestGenerator.createTestSet()</tt>.
  </li>
  
  <li> 
    If the data is for <tt>Y</tt>, a subtype or unrelated type for <tt>X</tt>,
    a call to the (fictive) static method YTestGenerator.createTestSet()</tt> will
    be inserted. For instance, <tt>dataY = YTestGenerator.generateTestData()</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>

<!--      
  <li>
    If the data is for a primitive Java type, a data array of size ten will be created,
loop that inserts random values into this array will be generated.
For instance, for int[] dataInt, the setUp method will contain the code
<pre>
public void setUp(){
  Random g = new Random();
  ..
  dataInt = new int[10];
  for(int i=0; i<dataInt.length; i++)
    dataInt[i] = g.nextInt();
  ..
}
</pre>
The necessary import java.util.Random will be added.
</li>
-->

<p>
  You should never modify the code in a generated test, such as 
  <tt>XTest</tt>. The current version of JAxT will unconditionally
  overwrite your changes next time you generate the tests.
</p>

<p>
  What you must modify, however, are the <tt>XTestGenerator</tt>
  classes. For each argument type T of every axiom tested in the 
  <tt>XTest</tt> a <tt>TTestGenerator</tt> class will be generated
  with a stub method <tt>T[] createTestSet()</tt>. You should fill
  in this method to provide an array (or you can change the return
  type to a <tt>Collection</tt>) of testable objects of type 
  <tt>T</tt>.
  JAxT will never overwrite an existing <tt>TTestGenerator</tt>  
  so you may modify it freely.
</p>

<!--
  If you are doing an incremental modification of an existing XTest
  class, new tests and data sets will be added.
Test methods not needed will be removed.
Arguments requiring new test data will induce those declarations.
If all tests needing a specific data item are removed, the declaration and inititalisation of this item will be commented out.
If such tests later are added, you may then either use the freshly generated test data declarations,
or you may delete these an uncomment the old ones if you prefer using them. 
-->


<h2>Writing test data sets</h2>

If you do not provide the test file with your data sets, 
the tests will be run on empty data sets, 
meaning that most of the probably will pass without anything being tested.

In order to provide test sets you should, for every type <tt>T</tt>, modify 
the <tt>createTestSet</tt> test generator stubs in the <tt>XTestGenerator</tt> classes.

<p>
The simplest extension is to simply return a few test cases in place of the original empty set of cases.
For example, consider a class <tt>X</tt> with a default constructor and a constructor that accepts
  an integer argument. In the corresponding <tt>XTestGenerator</tt>
  class you may want to implement the 
  <tt>createTestSet()</tt> method like this: 
</p>

<pre>
  X[] createTestSet() {
    return new X[] { new X(), new X(100), new X(0), 
                     new X(-1), new X(1), new X(100), 
                     new X(100000), new X(), new X(100) };
  }
</pre>

This gives a test data set of 9 elements.
Note that we have repeated some of the values several times in order that, 
among others transitivty axioms, will get cases which fully exercises them.
</p>

<p>
With the JAxT approach it is easy to provide much larger data sets, e.g., using the Java random number generator.
Assume we have an axiom with free variables of type <tt>int</tt>.
The JAxT generated test will then have an <tt>intTestGenerator</tt> class with a stub <tt>createTestSet()</tt>.
We can easily let it provide the tests with 100 randomly chosen integers between 1 and 50 
(note the oversampling in order to get several equal values).
<pre>
  int[] createTestSet() {
    Random g = new Random();
    int[] dataInt = new int[100];
    for(int i=0; i<dataInt.length; i++)
      dataInt[i] = g.nextInt(50)+1;
    return dataInt;
  }
</pre>
Remember to add the necessary import java.util.Random.
</p>

<p>
Of course this technique can also be used for the class <tt>X</tt> 
if it needs a larger test data set.
It can then be useful to place a method computing the data set in the class <tt>X</tt>
itself, and just call this method in the <tt>XTestGenerator</tt> class.
This has been done in the package <tt>jaxt.example.position</tt>,
where the static method <tt>Position.positionDataSet()</tt> creates 200
Position values for use in the tests.
</p>

<p>
Be warned that large data sets for axioms with many free variables takes its time to check.
A data set of 500 elements may be used to check axioms of 1-2 free variables in a few seconds.
But applying that test set to an axiom with four free variables, e.g. for checking the congruence of a binary operation like
<tt>jaxt.examples.position.Position.plus(Position)</tt>, we get 500^4 = 62 500 000 000 tests.
An overnight job for any reasonable computers.
</p>

<p>
In general you can also change the return 
  type of a <tt>TTestGenerator.createTestSet()</tt> from the array type <tt>T[]</tt> to a <tt>Collection</tt>) of testable objects of type 
  <tt>T</tt>. Make certain your collection class has iterators of the appropriate element type <tt>T</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  The <tt>TTestGenerator.createTestSet()</tt> method may require
  support from additional generator methods in <tt>T</tt>. It is
  recommended that these be declared with package visibility,
  so that they do not come part of the external interface of 
  <tt>T</tt> unless you explicitly think these could be useful.
