<title>JAxT framework support</title>
</head>
<body>
The package contains JAxT support interfaces, 
which serve as markers for the JAxT tool.
<p>
Any class implementing a subtype of <code>Axioms</code> are considered to contain axioms.
This is necessary for the JAxT support system in identifying axiom classes,
but also gives the user an easy way to recognise them as well:
looking at the javadoc generated list of all classes implementing the interface 
<code>jaxt.framework.Axioms</code> is an easy way to check if all axiom classes have been declared.
</p>
<p>
The marker <code>AxiomSet&lt;XA&gt;</code> indicates the the optional axioms in <code>XA</code> should be satisfied.
</p>
<p>
See the jaxt overview file for information about declaring and using axiom classes.
